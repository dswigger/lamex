Release 1.0

I was going to release this a lot sooner, but got
sidetracked with my job.  So here is release 1.0 of LameX
and LameEncoderX.  There are still bugs that I know of(and probably lots I do not know of):

-Strange Pop at beginning of song. (someone knows the solution to this)

You need MSVC 6.0 to compile both projects.

1)build the lame encoderX
2)build LameX (it relies on the activeX control)


Sorry for the brevity but I am pretty busy.

you may contact me at dswigger@accesscomm.net if you have any bug-fixes or
suggestions.

Thanks!
